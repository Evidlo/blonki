# Blonki - Web-based Anki Client Development Context

## Project Overview

Blonki is a web-based Anki client SPA built with Svelte 5 and TypeScript. The application provides a modern, responsive interface for spaced repetition learning with full support for importing/exporting Anki decks (.apkg files) and comprehensive data management.

## Current Architecture

### Core Application Structure
- **Five main tabs**: Learn, Edit, Stats, Settings, Extras
- **Responsive design**: Centered column layout optimized for desktop and mobile
- **Navigation**: Tab-based with persistent back button and ESC key support
- **Data storage**: Dual storage system (localStorage + File System Access API)
- **Theme system**: Light/dark mode with automatic detection

### State Management Architecture

#### Svelte Stores
- **`appStore`**: Application state, current view, navigation history
- **`settingsStore`**: User preferences, SRS algorithm settings, theme
- **`deckStore`**: Deck collection management
- **`cardStore`**: Card data, current card, study session state
- **`studySessionStore`**: Persistent study session (card index, show back, deck ID)

#### Storage Abstraction Layer
- **`StorageAdapter` interface**: Unified storage operations
- **`LocalStorageAdapter`**: Browser localStorage implementation
- **`FileSystemAccessAdapter`**: File System Access API implementation for transparent file operations
- **`StorageService`**: Centralized service managing all storage operations

### Service Layer

#### Core Services
- **`storageService`**: Data persistence, CRUD operations, import/export
- **`importService`**: File and URL-based data import (JSON, APKG)
- **`exportService`**: Data export functionality
- **`themeService`**: Theme management and persistence
- **`keyboardService`**: Keyboard shortcut handling

#### APKG Processing
- **`APKGParser`**: SQLite-based Anki deck parsing using sql.js
- **ZIP handling**: JSZip for APKG file extraction
- **Compression**: fzstd for Zstandard decompression (.anki21b files)
- **SQLite parsing**: sql.js with WASM for database queries

## File System Access API Design Guidelines

### Core Design Principles

#### 1. Transparent File Operations
- **Intent**: When "File System Access" storage type is selected, individual `.apkg` files are linked to specific paths on the user's disk
- **Behavior**: Any edits made to a deck are automatically saved back to its linked `.apkg` file
- **User Experience**: Seamless file-based workflow without explicit save operations

#### 2. Permission Management
- **Deferred Permissions**: File System Access API permission dialogs are deferred until the user performs a save operation after an edit
- **No Premature Prompts**: Opening a deck should not trigger permission dialogs
- **User Control**: Permissions only requested when user actually modifies data

#### 3. File Linking and State Management
- **Deck Linking**: Each deck can be linked to a `FileSystemFileHandle` for persistent storage
- **Location Display**: "Location" column shows full file path for linked decks, "Browser Storage" for unlinked decks
- **Error Handling**: File permission errors display as `[File Permission Error]` in Location column
- **Unlinking**: Deleting a deck unlinks it from the file before deletion to avoid permission dialogs

#### 4. Storage Adapter Pattern
- **`FileSystemAccessAdapter`**: Implements `StorageAdapter` interface for file-based operations
- **Hybrid Storage**: Uses `localStorage` as fallback and for unlinked decks
- **Change Tracking**: `hasUnsavedChanges` Map tracks which decks have been modified
- **Selective Saving**: Only saves to linked files when changes are detected

### Implementation Details

#### File Operations
```typescript
// Core file operations in FileSystemAccessAdapter
- linkDeckToFile(deckId: string, fileHandle: FileSystemFileHandle): void
- unlinkDeckFromFile(deckId: string): void
- getDeckFilePath(deckId: string): string
- isDeckLinkedToFile(deckId: string): boolean
- saveDeckToFile(deckId: string, deck: Deck, cards: Card[]): Promise<void>
- loadDeckFromFile(fileHandle: FileSystemFileHandle): Promise<{decks: Deck[], cards: Card[]}>
```

#### Data Flow
1. **File Opening**: User selects "Open from File" â†’ File System Access API â†’ Parse APKG â†’ Link deck to file
2. **Editing**: User modifies card â†’ `hasUnsavedChanges` flag set â†’ Save to localStorage + linked file
3. **Deletion**: User deletes deck â†’ Unlink from file â†’ Delete from localStorage
4. **Permission Handling**: File write operations trigger permission dialogs only when needed

#### UI/UX Guidelines
- **Location Column**: Replaces "Description" column in all deck views
- **File Path Display**: Shows full path for linked decks, "Browser Storage" for unlinked
- **Error States**: Clear indication of file permission errors
- **Tab Independence**: Each tab resets `selectedDeck` state on mount to prevent cross-tab interference

#### Supported File Formats
- **Primary**: `.apkg` files (Anki package format)
- **Future**: Potential support for other formats
- **Validation**: ZIP file signature validation and file extension checking
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation with user-friendly error messages

### Technical Architecture

#### Storage Service Integration
- **Centralized Management**: `StorageService` coordinates between `LocalStorageAdapter` and `FileSystemAccessAdapter`
- **Conditional Initialization**: `FileSystemAccessAdapter` only created when File System Access storage type is selected
- **Fallback Strategy**: Always maintains `localStorage` as backup storage
- **State Synchronization**: Svelte stores updated through centralized service calls

#### APKG Processing
- **Parser Integration**: `APKGParser` used for both File System Access and traditional import
- **File Validation**: ZIP signature validation, file size checks, extension verification
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful fallback to JSON parsing if APKG parsing fails
- **Deck Naming**: Uses filename (without extension) when parsed deck name is generic

### ðŸ“‹ Planned Features

#### Advanced Functionality
- [ ] Complete SRS algorithm implementation
- [ ] Advanced analytics and reporting
- [ ] Plugin system for Extras tab
- [ ] Offline support with service workers
- [ ] Multi-language support

#### Performance & Polish
- [ ] Large deck optimization
- [ ] Advanced error handling
- [ ] Unit and integration testing
- [ ] Accessibility improvements

#### Future Data Model Evolution
- [ ] **Multiple Card Formats Support**: Eventually support Anki's full data model (Notes, Cards, Templates, Fields)
- [ ] **Current Approach**: Maintain simplified card structure (front/back) as common denominator
- [ ] **Design Rationale**: Focus on core features while keeping data model simple and extensible
- [ ] **Migration Path**: When ready, can evolve to full Anki data model without breaking existing functionality
- [ ] **APKG Compatibility**: Generate proper APKG files that work with Anki while using simplified internal structure
