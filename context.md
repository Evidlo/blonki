# Blonki - Web-based Anki Client Development Context

## Project Overview

Blonki is a web-based Anki client SPA (Single Page Application) built with Svelte 5 and TypeScript. The application provides a modern, responsive interface for spaced repetition learning with support for importing/exporting Anki decks.

## Design Requirements & Discussion

### Core Application Structure
- **Five main tabs**: Learn, Edit, Stats, Settings, Extras
- **Responsive design**: Centered column layout that works on both desktop and mobile
- **Navigation**: Tab-based with back button/ESC key support for sub-views
- **Data storage**: Configurable between browser localStorage and Filesystem API

### User Flow Specifications

#### Learn Tab
- **1st view**: Table showing available decks with selection capability
- **Import functionality**: "Import from URL" and "Open from File" buttons above the table
- **2nd view**: Card review interface with front/back display and correct/incorrect tracking

#### Edit Tab
- **1st view**: Table showing available decks for editing
- **2nd view**: Card editing interface with front/back content modification and save functionality

#### Stats Tab
- **1st view**: Grid of cards with individual review plots
- **Analytics**: Reviews line plot showing number of reviews over the last month
- **Performance metrics**: Card-level statistics and learning progress

#### Settings Tab
- **Configuration options**: List of settings with input fields
- **SRS Algorithm**: Dropdown selection for spaced repetition algorithms
- **Storage preferences**: Choice between localStorage and Filesystem API
- **UI customization**: Theme, cards per session, and other preferences

#### Extras Tab
- **Plugin system**: Empty view intended for future plugin functionality

### Technical Requirements

#### Data Storage
- **Primary**: Browser localStorage for immediate functionality
- **Secondary**: Filesystem API support with browser compatibility detection
- **File formats**: Support for .apkg files with future expansion to other formats

#### Spaced Repetition System
- **Algorithms**: Support for basic Anki algorithm with configurability
- **Settings integration**: Algorithm selection via dropdown in Settings tab
- **Customization**: Configurable parameters for different SRS algorithms

#### UI/UX Requirements
- **Layout**: Centered column design using Flexbox for responsiveness
- **Mobile optimization**: Proper viewport handling and responsive tables
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, and screen reader support
- **Navigation**: ESC key and back button support for sub-view navigation

### Key Technologies
- **Frontend**: Svelte 5 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with PostCSS
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **State Management**: Svelte stores
- **File Handling**: anki-apkg-export library
- **Storage**: localStorage (primary), Filesystem API (planned)

## Development Notes

### Configuration Challenges Resolved
- **Tailwind CSS v4 Setup**: Initially had PostCSS configuration issues that were resolved by using the correct `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Implemented proper viewport handling and responsive table containers
- **ES Module Compatibility**: Fixed `require()` vs `import` syntax issues in configuration files

### Current Status
The application is fully functional with a complete UI implementation and working navigation. All core features are implemented with sample data, providing a solid foundation for data persistence and advanced functionality.

### Next Development Priorities
1. Complete data persistence integration
2. Implement real .apkg file import/export
3. Add comprehensive error handling
4. Implement theme system
5. Add unit testing framework

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Development Server
The application runs on `http://localhost:5173/` (or next available port) with hot module replacement for development.
